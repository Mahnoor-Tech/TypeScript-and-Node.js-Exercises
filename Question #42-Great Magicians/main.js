// 42- Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicians_names = ["John", "Eric", "Albert"];
function make_great(magicians_names) {
    for (var i = 0; i < magicians_names.length; i++) {
        console.log("The great magician" + " " + magicians_names[i] + ".\n");
    }
}
make_great(magicians_names);
